# alphanumericpuzzlesolver
This is a code that is created to solve alphanumerical puzzles using a few constraints for a homework.
In the homework I was asked to use a tree structure while solving the problem.
When using the code you should enter the following command line arguments:
Traversal Algorithm, Three words with blanks in between
Available traversal algorithms are BFS and DFS
E.g. : "./solver.exe DFS TWO TWO FOUR"
